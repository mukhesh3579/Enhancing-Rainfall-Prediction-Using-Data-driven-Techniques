# Enhancing-Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Data-driven-Techniques
The occurrence of rainfall is critical for various sectors such as agriculture, hydrology,and disaster management. Accurate prediction of rainfall can aid in better planning and decision-making. The traditional methods of predicting rainfall based on historical data have limitations in terms of accuracy and timeliness. Machine learning algorithms can leverage various weather-related parameters to make accurate rainfall predictions. The aim of this project is to develop an ML-based rain prediction model using Flask, which can predict the probability of rainfall for a given location and time period. The model should be able to handle various data sources and provide real-time predictions. The model's accuracy and performance should be evaluated on different datasets, and the results should be presented through a user-friendly web interface.
